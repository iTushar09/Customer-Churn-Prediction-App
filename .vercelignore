# Exclude the Jupyter Notebook (very important)
CustomerChurnPredictionusingML.ipynb

# Exclude the original dataset if app1.py doesn't use it directly
# (Your app1.py doesn't seem to read ccpdata.csv, so it's probably safe to exclude)
ccpdata.csv

# Exclude training scripts
train_save_model.py
churn_model.py # If it's only used for model loading, and not other helper functions
                # BUT: app1.py imports churn_model.py, so we NEED churn_model.py.
                # Do NOT exclude churn_model.py! Re-evaluate if it's big.
                # My apologies, churn_model.py IS needed. So do NOT exclude it.
